## The Algorithm

This program uses an AI model trained to recognise certain hand gestures. Using this AI it plays rock paper scissors with the user.  
It first takes a picture of the user and their hand inputs with a webcam. It then uses this webcam image and plugs it into the AI model. The AI model decides what hand gesture the image is depicting. It takes the depicted image as an input value for whether the user plays rock, paper or scissors.  
The computer's decision is processed via a random number generator. The two values are then compared to decides who wins the round. Rounds are continuously played until the user stops the program.
